## Evaluating MLB Player’s Value: 2024 Offensive Performance vs Salary 

# MLB Hitting and Salary Analysis (2024)

This project analyzes 2024 MLB player offensive statistics and salary data to answer three research questions:

1. Which batting stats are most predictive of OPS and RBI?
2. How does age impact offensive performance?
3. Are higher-paid players producing better results than lower-paid players?
